# Handwritten-Numerical-Solver-with-6-Classes:

Considered 6 different Classes (1,2,3,4,+,*) for our Analysis. We fetch the right results by solving Real case Equations by building different Models of Convolution Neural Networks. Each Class consists of 50 Images. 

# Introduction:

Handwriting is an integral feature of human communications. In addition to smartphones and tablets, new devices such as interactive panels, digital pens, and smart writing surfaces have become widely adopted in offices and educational institutions, opening up new opportunities for technologies that recognise specific handwritten content such as mathematics and diagrams.

The advancements in the field of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing have fostered robust Human Computer Interaction. Computers are being familiarized with the irregularities of the real world. This facilitates humans to use the computing power to perform otherwise time-consuming tasks and solve complex real-world problems. One such application is in the field of mathematics, that is, to solve handwritten mathematical equations.

Solving mathematical equations is an integral part of science right from basic schooling to major research applications. The computing power of today can give a great boost to solving mathematical equations at all levels. Given the level of complexity a mathematical equation can reach, it is simpler and faster to write it by hand than type it on a computer. A machine learning enabled handwritten equation solver can be a very important tool to simplify calculations.

# AIM OF THE PROJECT:

The aim of this project is to build a deep learning model that can recognise handwritten numbers and mathematical symbols, read it as an equation and evaluate it to give the solution.

# CONCLUSIONS:

The final model was able to correctly identify and evaluate most of the samples, but on some occasions it failed to identify one or more characters due to the lack of trainingsamples.

# CHALLENGES

• Limited number of image classes and trainingsamples.

• Infinite irregularities in handwritten characters.

• Misinterpretation of characters lead to incorrectevaluation.
